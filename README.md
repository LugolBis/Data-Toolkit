# Data-Toolkit

**Data-Toolkit** is a Java-based project that provides a set of tools for working with data structures, algorithms, and mathematical concepts. It is designed for educational purposes, prototyping, and reusable component development in the domain of data processing and algorithmic problem solving.

## Features

### üßÆ Mathematical Concepts
- **Vectors** : Multi-dimensional vector operations.
- **Matrices** : Basic linear algebra operations.
- **Distances** : *Euclidean*, *Manhattan*, *Minkowski* and *Levenshtein*.
- **Points** : Representation and manipulation of *N*-dimensional points.
- **Similarities** : *Jackard* similarity and other comparison metrics.

### üóÇÔ∏è Data Structures
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** : Insertion, search, etc.
- **Stack** : LIFO data structure implementation.
- **Queue** : FIFO data structure implementation.
- **Linked List** : Single linked list with standard operations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** : Shortest path calculation in weighted graphs.
- **Hierarchical Clustering (CAH)** : Agglomerative clustering algorithm for hierarchical grouping and Dendrogram.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** : A non-parametric supervised learning method, used for Classification.

## Getting Started
